<b>Revisiting a classic tool, the file pumper! For educational uses only, I am not responsible for any malicious acts.</b>

Purpose:
Increases the size of a file by adding null hexadecimal value(s) (00) to the end depending on the amount the user wants in KB, MB, GB, or TB.

GUI:
The graphical user interface was programmed line by line, I didn't use any IDE that constructs the GUI for the programmer. Reasoning why is that I took this up as a challenge to better understand how grids work using Java. Above all, it is user friendly.

Data table:
8 BITS = 1 BYTE
1000 BYTE = 1 KB
1000 KB = 1 MB
1000 MB = 1 GB
1000 GB = TB

Extra information:
Example: Step increment of 1 input value = 1 KB
Minimum: 1 and the Maximum: 999 for input value.
