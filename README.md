<b>Revisiting a classic tool, the file pumper! For educational uses only, I am not responsible for any malicious acts.</b>

Function:
Increases the size of a file by adding null hexadecimal value(s) (00) to the end depending on the amount the user wants in KB, MB, GB, or TB.

GUI:
The graphical user interface was programmed line by line, I didn't use any IDE that constructs the GUI for the programmer. Reasoning why is that I took this up as a challenge to better understand how grids work using Java. Above all, it is user friendly.
